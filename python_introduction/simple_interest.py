# Objective: Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

#Task Description:

#Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

#( I ) is the interest earned,
#( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
#( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
#( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

#Instructions:

#Create a file named simple_interest.py.
#Define three variables in this file:
#principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
#rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
#time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
#Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.

principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05      # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3         # Time in years 
interest = principal * rate * time  # Calculate simple interest
print("The simple interest is", interest)  # Output the result
